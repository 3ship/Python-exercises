# Python exercises

## practicepython.org

The list of exercises, including full descriptions, can be found on [practicepython.org](https://www.practicepython.org/)

I solved them while simultaneously learning the basics of Python through the [tutorial on W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python/). In lieau of a native Python installation or IDE, I initially solved the more basic exercises in an online Python compiler.

To other people starting out with Python I would recommend the eBook *Python for Everybody* (see below), along with installing [Thonny](https://thonny.org/), a simple Python IDE for beginners.

## Python for Everybody

All exercises originate from the German translation of the free eBook *Python for Everybody*, 1st edition. The book can be found in various languages on [PY4E](https://www.py4e.com/book.php)

## Think Python

Exercises are from the eBook *Think Python*, 2nd edition, which can be found on [greenteapress.com](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/).
